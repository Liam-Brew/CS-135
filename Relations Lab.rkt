;; At the bottom of the file will be a lot of functions that will be helpful for this lab.
;; This lab is a review of relations.
;; A relation is a set of unique integer tuples

;; Define id
;; id should take an integer and create the set id.
;; This means it should create the pairs (1 1) (2 2) ... (n n)
;; Order does not matter

;; Examples:
;; (id 1) -> '((1 1))
;; (id 5) -> '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3) (4 4) (5 5))

;; Type Signature: (id int) -> relation

(define (id n)
    (if (equal? n 0)
        '()
        (cons (list n n) (id (- n 1)))))

;; Define reflexive?
;; reflexive? takes a relation and max int size and returns if the relation is reflexive.
;; A relation is reflexive if it contains the id relation.
;; This can be done easily using id and one of the functions provided.

;; Examples:
;; (reflexive? '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3)) 3) -> #t
;; (reflexive? '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3) (3 2) (2 3)) 3) -> #t
;; (reflexive? '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3)) 4) -> #f

;; Type Signature: (reflexive? relation int) -> boolean

(define (reflexive? relation n)  
    (if (subset? (id n) relation)
        #t
        #f))

;; Define reflexive-closure
;; Reflexive closure adds the id relation to a given relation
;; This can be done easily using id and one of the functions provided.
;; Order does not matter

;; Examples:
;; (reflexive-closure '() 3) -> '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3))
;; (reflexive-closure '((3 2) (2 3)) 3) -> '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3) (3 2) (2 3))
;; (reflexive-closure '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3)) 4) -> '((1 1) (2 2) (3 3) (4 4))

;; Type Signature: (reflexive-closure relation int) -> relation

(define (reflexive-closure relation n)
    (if (not (reflexive? relation n))
        (make-set (append (id n) relation))
        relation))

;; Define flip-pairs
;; flip-pairs takes a relation and changes all (x y) pairs into (y x)
;; This can be done with simple recursion and using the reverse keyword
;; Order does not matter in the set.


;; Examples:
;; (flip-pairs '((1 2) (3 2) (4 5))) -> '((2 1) (2 3) (5 4))
;; (flip-pairs '((1 1) (1 2) (1 3))) -> '((1 1) (2 1) (3 1))

;; Type Signature: (flip-pairs relation) -> relation

(define (flip-pairs relation)
    (if (null? relation)
        '()
        (cons (reverse (car relation)) (flip-pairs (cdr relation)))))

;; Define symmetric?
;; symmetric? takes a relation and returns if the relation is symmetric.
;; A relation is symmetric iff for every (x y) pair it has (y x)
;; This can be done easily using flip-pairs and one of the functions provided.

;; Examples:
;; (symmetric? '((1 1) (2 1) (1 2))) -> #t
;; (symmetric? '((1 1) (2 4) (3 7) (3 5) (5 3))) -> #f
;; (symmetric? '((2 4) (4 3) (3 4) (4 2))) -> #t

;; Type Signature: (reflexive? relation int) -> boolean

(define (symmetric? relation)
   (if (subset? (flip-pairs relation) relation)
       #t
       #f))

;; Define symmetric-closure
;; Symmetric closure adds the symmetric pairs to a given relation
;; So for every (x y) pair it adds (y x) iff (y x) isn't in the set already.
;; This can be done easily using flip-pairs and one of the functions provided.
;; Order does not matter

;; Examples:
;; (symmetric-closure '()) -> '()
;; (symmetric-closure '((3 2) (2 3))) -> '((3 2) (2 3))
;; (symmetric-closure '((1 2) (2 7) (3 4))) -> '((1 2) (2 7) (3 4) (2 1) (7 2) (4 3))

;; Type Signature: (reflexive-closure relation int) -> relation

(define (symmetric-closure relation)
  (if (not (symmetric? relation))
      (make-set (append relation (flip-pairs relation)))
      (car (list relation))))

;; Define related-to
;; related to takes an element and relation and returns the list of elements that the given element is related to
;; On a given (x y) pair an element is related to y iff the element is the same as x

;; Examples:
;; (related-to 3 '((3 3) (3 4) (3 5))) -> '(3 4 5)
;; (related-to 1 '((1 2) (2 3) (3 4) (4 5))) -> '(2)
;; (related-to 2 '((1 3) (3 5) (4 6) (8 2))) -> '()
